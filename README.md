# Tx.ApplicationInsights.Session

When working with [ApplicationInsights](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) you sometimes need to see whether data is sent out. For that purposes you can use [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler).

But also sometimes you want to filter that data, find some specific events or metrics, from certain users or with certain customer properties.

With [Tx.ApplicationInsights.Session](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tx.ApplicationInsights.Session/) nuget you can create a live session and run LINQ queries to filter data.
