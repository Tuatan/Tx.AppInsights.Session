# Tx.AppInsights.Session

When working with ApplicationInsights you sometimes need to see whether data is sent out. For that purposes you can use Fiddler.

But also sometimes you want to filter that data, find some specific events or metrics, from certain users or with certain customer properties.

With Tx.ApplicationInsights.Session nuget you can create a live session and run LINQ queries to filter data.
